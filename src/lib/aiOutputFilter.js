// ── AI-09: deterministic post-generation output filter (AUDIT_SEC_02 F-03) ──
// The Clinical Safety Core (src/prompts/core.js) instructs the model never to
// give specific action guidance (dose changes, start/stop directives) — but
// that instruction lives entirely in the system prompt, with no deterministic
// backstop if the model ignores it, is jailbroken, or simply errs. This module
// is that backstop: a pure, regex-based scan run on AI text AFTER generation,
// before it is ever rendered — the same "deterministic, not the model" principle
// as the A-01 tripwire engine (DEC-002).
//
// The hard part is not detecting directive language — it's not flagging the
// SAFE reminder sentences the CSC explicitly wants the model to say, e.g.
// "Don't stop taking your medication without asking your doctor first." That
// sentence contains "stop taking" but is the opposite of a prohibited
// directive: it's a caution AGAINST unsupervised changes. A naive keyword
// match would censor exactly the sentence the safety rules are trying to
// produce. So this scans sentence-by-sentence and skips any sentence that
// also carries a nearby negation/caution marker (don't, without asking your
// doctor, before talking to your care team, etc.) — those are the guardrail
// sentences, not the violation.
//
// Deliberately NOT covered (documented limitation, not a gap pretending to be
// closed): third-person/past-tense record echoes ("Your care team increased
// your Tacrolimus to 5mg last visit") are facts about the record, not the AI
// giving an instruction — the patterns below target second-person imperative
// and first-person-recommendation phrasing specifically, which is what the
// CSC actually prohibits the model from originating.
